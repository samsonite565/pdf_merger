# pdf_merger
The following is takes pdf files and merges them together
I am just starting out to  learn to code and this is one of my first scripts

This script is relatively simple and was created to address my difficulty in merging PDF files, particularly with Adobe products. Additionally, I often had to rely on online tools to merge files, so I decided to write a program to handle the task locally.

If there are any improvements or optimizations that can be made to this script, I would greatly appreciate your guidance. This feedback would not only enhance the script but also provide me with valuable learning opportunities.

Thank you for your assistance!
